/*Good â€” hereâ€™s a clean set of **mini programming assignments** after **Chapter 17 (Object-Oriented Programming in Rust)**:

---

**1. Traits as Interfaces (Basic OOP)**

- Define a trait `Animal` with a method `speak(&self) -> String`.
- Implement `Animal` for `Dog` and `Cat` structs.
- Write a function that takes a `&dyn Animal` and prints what it says.

---

**2. Trait Objects in a Collection**

- Create a `Vec<Box<dyn Animal>>` holding different types (Dog, Cat, etc.).
- Loop through the vector and call `speak` on each animal.

Would you want me to also group these by **easy / medium / hard** like I offered for Chapter 16?  
It would give you a clean sprint path if you want to knock them out fast! ðŸ”¥ */
